# Chapter Five: The Search for Pipe

---

The song echoed through the [[Cross Bones Pub]] as [[Aeris Whisperwind]] performed for the evening crowd. She sang of spider-filled tunnels, of a Drider's dark bargain, of scholars who chose to become vessels for something ancient and terrible. The patrons listened with rapt attention, unaware that soon the bard and her companions would be called to another task entirely.

It was late when two messages arrived almost simultaneously.

A knock at the door—a guard bearing an official summons to the [[TownHall]] for ten o'clock the following morning. [[Mirr]], answering without bothering to dress, received the sealed letter with characteristic indifference to propriety.

But there was another message. A letter slipped beneath the door, written in a shaking hand. A simple map. A plea for help finding a lost daughter.

The party chose not to wait for morning.

[[Kass]] ventured into the forest to retrieve [[Selune]], while the others set out through the darkened streets to find the letter's author. They arrived at the home of [[Roderick Ashford]] near midnight.

The man who answered was a shadow of what he must once have been. Elderly, fragile, with hands that trembled as he spoke. But his eyes—his eyes still held hope.

"My daughter," he said. "[[Pipe Ashford|Pipe]]. She went missing three years ago. Everyone stopped looking. Everyone but me."

He told them the story. Pipe had been one of the first settlers, arriving with the pioneers who founded Thornhaven. After her mother Maren died during the Quiet Year, Pipe had become obsessed with understanding [[Blood root]]—the herb that had failed to save her. She asked questions no one could answer. And then, one morning, she was simply gone.

"But last week," Roderick continued, his voice cracking, "[[Venn]] the Waterkeeper saw her. On the mountain. Alive."

The next morning brought them to the [[TownHall]], where [[Eman]] waited.

The Mayor of Thornhaven was an imposing figure—dark skin, striking green eyes, curly black hair, and the strong physique of someone who had earned their position through more than politics alone. She presented herself as a concerned leader seeking to reunite a family.

"One of our founding settlers vanished years ago," Eman explained. "Her family still grieves. I need people I can trust to find her and bring her home."

She introduced them to Venn—a gruff dwarf in his 250s who clearly despised being in the city. As Thornhaven's Waterkeeper, he maintained the irrigation channels from the [[World/Thornhaven Region/Veiled Peaks|Veiled Peaks]] that fed the farmlands below. He had also built much of the city itself: the stone walls, most houses, the water channels, even the [[Scarsith Temple]].

Venn gave them a map and little else. His information was shallow, his manner curt. He wanted nothing more than to return to his mountains.

But Eman added one more detail: "Other mercenaries are also looking. I don't put all my eggs in one basket."

The party accepted both quests—Eman's official commission and Roderick's desperate plea. They purchased winter gear and set out for the Veiled Peaks.

The mountains were unforgiving.

The Ice Bridge came first—a narrow crossing over a chasm that seemed to drop into eternity. Selune slipped, plunging into the icy creek below before the others could catch her.

Then came the snowstorm. A whiteout that reduced visibility to mere feet, howling winds that threatened to scatter them across the mountainside. But they navigated through, emerging battered but together.

They found Venn's cabin as darkness fell. The Waterkeeper refused to open his door.

Through the frosted window, they glimpsed another figure inside—a giant woman, tall and powerful. Venn's personal life, it seemed, was something he guarded more jealously than his maps.

The party made camp outside, the cold seeping into their bones despite the winter gear.

They woke at dawn to find they were not alone.

A white wolf watched them from the mist. Large. Intelligent. Patient. Its eyes followed their movements with an awareness that went beyond mere animal instinct.

Then it vanished, disappearing into the mountain fog as silently as it had appeared.

Somewhere above them, past Cloudbreak Pass, past the Sunbleached Plateau where the air grew thin and dry, Pipe Ashford waited.

But the wolves were watching too.
