# Chapter Two: The Hostage Hoax

---

The zombie threat had scarcely been addressed when new trouble arrived at the [[Cross Bones Pub]]. [[Grewdil Pierce]] burst through the doors, his face pale with terror. His daughter, [[Yeni Pierce]], had been kidnapped.

A ransom note had been left—written in a shaky hand, demanding 500 gold pieces be left at the [[Scarsith Temple|altar]] by day's end. Grewdil claimed to have no enemies who would do such a thing.

The adventurers—[[Mirr]], [[Kass]], [[Aeris Whisperwind]], and [[Selune]]—took up the case. Their investigation revealed a twist: while Yeni Pierce had indeed been taken, the ransom exchange itself was fake. Someone was playing a deeper game.

A captain of adventurers named Laurel Quay seemed connected to Yeni's situation. Was Yeni planning to leave with this adventuring company? Was the kidnapping staged? Or was there something more sinister at work?

The plot thickened, but the full truth remained elusive.
