# Interlude: The Scarsith Summons

---

One year after the Saving War, [[Thornhaven]] had found an uneasy peace. Mayor [[Eman]] ruled with a steady hand, and the [[Scarsith Temple]] continued its mission—feeding the hungry, sheltering the broken, teaching that the rat endures where the lion falls.

But something stirred in the shadows of that faith.

Priestess [[Nell]] sent letters across the land—urgent, cryptic, asking for aid she could not name. Three souls answered her call.

**[[Brynn Ashveil]]**, a halfling cleric from the Survivor's Rest, had spent her life on coastal supply vessels and in refugee temples. She knew hunger—the gnawing kind that keeps you moving when reason says stop. She had watched her closest friend vanish beneath the waves and found in [[Scarsith]] a faith that didn't flinch from loss. When Nell's letter arrived, Brynn packed a bag. You don't question a reputation like Nell's.

**[[Quickfoot]]**, a human raised by paladins of the Temple of the Iron Tail, understood hunger differently. He had grown up in slums, adopted by the faithful, given a name for his playful spirit even in starvation. For him, "true hunger" meant the emptiness—the loss of hope, of family made not by blood but by oath. Nell's letter sparked something in him: the desire to punish those who cause hunger.

**[[Qualam]]**, an elven paladin, came for reasons known only to himself.

The three arrived in Thornhaven as strangers but found each other quickly enough. Their first test came not in the temple, but in a graveyard.

Grave robbers. Three of them, plus their leader—common thugs disturbing the dead for coin. The fight was brutal. Only three clerics against four desperate criminals, and every blow counted. Steel rang against steel in the moonlit cemetery, prayers mixed with curses, and when it was done, the robbers lay defeated.

It was then that [[Nell]] appeared.

"The rat endures where the lion falls," she said—the traditional greeting of the faithful.

The party hesitated. The correct response eluded them, or perhaps exhaustion had dulled their memories of doctrine. Whatever the reason, Nell's expression shifted. Trust, so nearly offered, withdrew behind careful eyes.

She directed them to the temple nonetheless. Rest first. Questions later.

At the [[Scarsith Temple]], an older halfling priest greeted them warmly. Brother [[Bramwell]] had gray-streaked curly hair and laugh lines that suggested a man who had smiled often—though he wasn't smiling now. His bare feet padded on the stone floors as he led them through the building, chattering about the accommodations, the weather, the quality of the beds.

But sometimes he paused mid-sentence. Stared at nothing. Then continued as if nothing had happened.

"You've come a long way," he said. "You must be... *hungry*."

The way he said the word lingered strangely in the air.

The clerics were given rooms. The temple settled into night. And somewhere in the darkness, questions waited that none of them yet knew to ask.
