# Chapter One: The Festival of Victory

---

Five years passed. The village had grown and prospered. What was once a desperate settlement of refugees had become a proper town, complete with a [[Library|library]], an [[Apothecary|apothecary]], a [[TownHall|town hall]], and an [[Army Building|army building]]. The Dragonborns and Goliaths had established their own quarter called [[Aussen]], just outside the main walls.

The [[Cross Bones Pub]], founded by [[Mills Senior]] and now run by his son [[Mills]], had become a beloved institution. Mills himself was an eccentric fellow with a peculiar hobby—collecting bones, though he could never quite tell human remains from animal.

It was the eve of a great festival, a celebration commemorating the army's victorious battle against the Owls. Four adventurers found themselves at Mills' tavern:

- **[[Mirr]]**, a Warlock-Fighter of formidable skill
- **[[Kass]]**, a capable warrior
- **[[Aeris Whisperwind]]**, a Wood Elf Bard who served as the pub's regular musician
- **[[Salune]]**, a Druid attuned to the natural world

But the festive atmosphere was disrupted by dark tidings. Mills confided in the adventurers that zombies had been attacking every night for the past week. The party overheard the priestess [[Nell]] speaking urgently with Mills about "all these attacks." Nell and her priests had been fighting the undead, and they suspected the source was the old graveyard.

The adventurers ventured to investigate. At the graveyard's entrance, poisonous mushrooms sprouted like warnings. And there, among the tombstones, they witnessed a chilling sight: a skeleton man astride a skeleton horse, both clad in ancient armour. A knight of death, riding through the realm of the dead.

A troubling theory emerged—had Mills, in his obsessive bone collecting, disturbed something that should have remained buried? Perhaps even stolen an arm from something that wanted it back?
