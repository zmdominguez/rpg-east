# Chapter Four: The Thelasian Webs

---

The discovery of the Thelasian Lost City had opened a door that could not be closed. [[Dr Clair Bucklebub]], ever driven by scholarly curiosity, was not content with a single find. She believed more Thelasian settlements lay hidden beneath the earth—and she was determined to find them.

When her excavation team returned from a month of travelling sharing the news about the lost city, they discovered something unexpected. Red webbing, stretched across the passages. More troubling still, [[Blood root|Bloodroot]]—the precious medicinal herb—grew in unnatural patterns, intertwined with the strange webs.

"Bloodroot doesn't grow like this," [[Naven]] the herbalist observed when he joined the expedition. "Something is farming it."

[[Dr Clair Bucklebub]] reached out through the [[Cross Bones Pub]] seeking experienced adventurers. The Cross Bones Inc party was unavailable, so three others answered the call: [[Aeris Whisperwind]], [[Mirr]], and [[Salune]].

The party watched the tunnels entry and encountered **Bri**.

The giant spider did not attack. Instead, she spoke. She led them deeper still, through passages thick with red webbing, until they reached a chamber where darkness seemed to breathe.

The party descended into the tunnels. The air carried a faint sweet smell, and the temperature dropped with each step deeper. They passed animal carcasses wrapped in silk, evidence that something very much alive dwelt in these depths.

There stood [[Akor]]—a Drider, dark elf torso fused with a massive spider body. His eyes reflected red in the torchlight, and when he spoke, his voice was calm and persuasive despite his broken Common.

Akor spoke of "the Weaver."

He offered them a deal: to become "vessels" that could accept the Thelasian city. What this meant, he did not fully explain. But his words carried a weight that suggested ancient power and terrible purpose.

[[Dr Clair Bucklebub]] accepted.

So did her entire research team—Tarvyn, Isolde, Bram, Kesra, Dunley, and Mira. Six scholars, plus their leader, willingly embracing whatever transformation Akor promised.

The adventurers did not.

They left the tunnels that day with more questions than answers. No blood was shed, no battle fought. But something had begun in those depths—something that connected the mysterious Bloodroot, the lost Thelasian civilization, and a being called the Weaver.

The spiders were watching. And now they had seven new vessels.
