# Chapter Three: The Truth About Eman

---

The child who had arrived during the Quiet Year was no ordinary refugee. [[Eman]] had grown to become the Mayor of Thornhaven—an Aasimar of celestial blood, respected and trusted by all.

But Eman harbored a secret. Unknown to the public, the Mayor was a Druid of the Owl Cult. Eman had been sent to help the cult in their struggle against the pioneers—the very settlers who had built this village. Instead, Eman had chosen a different path: to rule the city rather than destroy it.

A group of adventurers—Caipora, Silvering, TalonShay, and Morris—set out to uncover the truth. Their investigation led them to encounter figures of power and knowledge:

- **[[Gravy]]**, the Eldest Owl, ancient and knowing
- **[[Vian Out]]**, a guard at the East gate, father of Kele and husband to Hun
- **[[Reven]]**, Commander of the army
- **[[Anni]]**, the librarian who kept Thornhaven's records and secrets

Each held pieces of the puzzle. The adventurers pieced together the truth of Eman's origins and the Owl Cult's influence over the region.

But their investigation did not go smoothly. Their actions caused a scandal that spread through the city like wildfire. The revelation of connections between their mayor and the hated Owls turned the common folk against the creatures who had long threatened their borders.

What had been a tense but stable coexistence erupted into open conflict.

This became known as **The Saving War**—though whether it saved Thornhaven or merely transformed one conflict into another remains a matter of perspective. The pioneers had sought to build a peaceful home; now they found themselves at war once more.
