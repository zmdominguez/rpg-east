# Prologue: The Quiet Year

---

In the aftermath of a brutal war with the Jackals, a band of weary survivors found themselves in an untamed wilderness. They had won their freedom, but the cost had been great. Now, they needed to build something new—a home.

The land they chose was rich with promise. Iron veins ran through the hills, fresh water flowed freely, the forests offered abundant wood, and wildlife roamed the surrounding plains. But this was no paradise. Danger lurked in the shadows, particularly in the form of the Owls—predators who dwelt near the body of water. The settlers whispered that these creatures were once people, transformed as punishment for some ancient transgression.

During this formative year, the settlers established their village with care. At its centre rose a common hall, a well for fresh water, and a pub that would become the heart of community life. On the outskirts, they built an altar dedicated to Scarsith, and discovered a cave filled with bats whose guano would fertilize their crops.

They learned to read the signs of this new land. A green-tinged sunrise meant good fortune ahead. The mysterious [[Blood root|Blood Root]], a powerful medicinal herb, grew in the region—and those who lived in the trees near the lake knew its secrets.

A machine was found and repaired, one that attracted wildlife to the area. Its manual was recovered, promising future benefits for the community.

But the Quiet Year was not without tragedy. A settler named [[Pipe]] spoke of good wood to be found nearby, but when his mother died, something changed in him. Eventually, Pipe vanished without a trace.

Most mysteriously, a child named [[Eman]] arrived in town. The circumstances were troubling—the child went missing shortly after arrival, and a note bearing the drawing of Blood Root was found. An old man who knew the herb's secrets fell down the well. A group of travelers appeared, and it became clear they had been chasing Eman. A witch began cultivating Blood Root, sensing its importance.

The Quiet Year ended with more questions than answers.
