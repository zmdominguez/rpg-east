# Interlude: The Cross Bones Expedition

---

While the main events unfolded in the village, another group of adventurers embarked on a different quest entirely. Three souls—[[Jinx]], [[Nyra]], and [[Reverend Aldric]]—answered a flyer seeking a party of adventurers to meet at the [[Library|library]].

There they met [[Dr Clair Bucklebub]], a scholar researching the ancient Thelasian civilization. Her excavation team had uncovered something remarkable near the swamp—and something dangerous. When they disturbed stone slabs at the dig site, monsters made of grass and swamp had attacked, driving them away.

The adventurers agreed to help. At the dig site, they found a stone slab bearing an inscription:

> *Come as you are and be refused*
> *Come as you were and enter true*

The solution was ritual cleansing—wash hands and touch the door. It opened to reveal a spiral stone staircase descending into darkness, illuminated only by bioluminescent glowworms. Deeper still, a tunnel stretched into shadow, its air thick with fungal dust that could cause blindness.

They reached a pool with another inscription:

> *All who go further must be clean of body and mind*
> *Step carefully... impurity will be punished*

Stepping into the pool, they emerged sparkling clean—purified for what lay ahead.

Beyond was an underground town, perfectly preserved. Clean, organized, with no signs of hurried departure. The Thelasians had simply... left. Or had they?

In a temple-like building, a final inscription waited on a stone tablet:

> *Though we dwell here long and deep*
> *In the shadows we no longer creep*
> *...pay the price for those unclean*

As Dr. Clair read the words, she fainted. The tablet shattered. And a janitor golem appeared, carrying a broom and dustpan, as if the city had been waiting for someone to clean up after visitors once more.

Dr. Clair believed other Thelasian civilizations might still exist somewhere, hidden beneath the earth. The discovery of this lost city opened more doors than it closed.
