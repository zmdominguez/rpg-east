## 🕯️ Backstory

Abandoned as a child and grew up in the slums, knowing hunger and hardship intimately. Was adopted by paladins of the Temple of the Iron Tail and given the name "Quickfoot" due to his playful characteristics - even when facing hunger.

The paladins raised him with their Oath of Vengeance, teaching him to punish those who commit violence against the temple and those who cause hunger. He carries the doctrines of the church with high faith and devotion, never forgetting the hunger and hardships of his past.

Receiving [[Nell]]'s letter sparked the fire and desire to quench hunger, following the teachings that shaped him. He left his security, his people who relieved him of his hunger, not knowing if he would face danger or worse - true hunger.

## 👨‍🎤 Description

- Playful nature despite serious past
- Deep understanding of hunger - both physical and spiritual
- Devoted to the teachings of [[Scarsith]]

## 📝 Notes

- Temple: Temple of the Iron Tail
- Raised by paladins (Oath of Vengeance)
- **True Hunger**: The emptiness. Loss of hope. Loss of family - not by blood but by oath. His greatest fear.
- "For Quickfoot, survival is everything. But to suffer true hunger again is his true fear and he will do anything not to face it again."
