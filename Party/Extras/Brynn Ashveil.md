## 🧑‍🎨 Portrait

## 🕯️ Backstory

Brynn grew up at the Survivor's Rest, a coastal refugee settlement, having arrived there as an infant when her fishing village was destroyed by a storm. She spent her life split between crewing supply vessels along the coast and tending to the sick and displaced at the temple of [[Scarsith]].

She lost her closest friend, Coll, to the sea at nineteen. Another Rest kid who'd crewed with her from their first voyage. He went overboard in a squall and she was the one who saw it happen and couldn't reach him in time. The grief sent her to the temple - not for comfort, but for a theology that could hold that kind of loss without flinching. Scarsith's faith doesn't promise things will be okay. It promises you'll endure.

She was ordained quietly, without ceremony, which suited her.

She received a letter from Priestess [[Nell]] of [[Thornhaven]] marked urgent. She doesn't know Nell personally, but knows her reputation - someone actually feeding people, not just talking about Scarsith's teachings. When someone like that sends a letter marked urgent, you don't write back asking for more detail. You pack a bag.

## 👨‍🎤 Description

- Travels light, speaks plainly
- Will patch up anyone who needs it without asking what they deserve
- Matter-of-fact bedside manner - doesn't pretend death isn't in the room, but doesn't let it run the conversation either
- "We gnaw through, together."
