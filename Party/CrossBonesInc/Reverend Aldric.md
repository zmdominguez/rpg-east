## 👨‍🎤 Description
Aldric was one of the first settlers who helped found our city. He came with his husband, his adopted daughter, and her two kids to start over. Years later, an owl attack killed his husband and daughter, and his grandkids cut ties with him in the aftermath. Aldric didn’t pursue them—he withdrew to the graveyard and lived there in isolation as its caretaker.

He’s calm, disciplined, and protective: more “soldier-priest” than edgy necromancer. If he uses undead, it’s minimal and practical—never for cruelty or shock value—and he keeps things respectful and non-gory at the table. He travels with the party because graves are being disturbed and bodies are going missing, and he knows a peaceful city provides a peaceful graveyard, and that's his goal
