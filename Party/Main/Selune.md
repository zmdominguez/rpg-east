## 👨‍🎤 Description

No one knows where Selune’thiel came from—not even the elves who found her. She appeared one night at the edge of the High Forest, wrapped in dark cloth stitched with strange symbols, left at the roots of an ancient white oak. The moon that night was thin and pale, almost sickly, and the woodland spirits whispered uneasily as the infant cried.

The druids of the Circle of the Moon took her in reluctantly. The air around her was _wrong_, cold, as if touched by something that lived beyond the natural cycle. There were rumours—quiet, fearful ones—that she was created for a darker purpose, perhaps shaped by a cult that sought to twist moon magic into corruption.

But the child did not fulfil their suspicions.

Instead, she grew into nature’s fiercest protector.

The moonlight that once chilled the leaves now warmed her skin. The beasts of the forest approached her without fear. She listened more to the wind and the earth than to people, learning to shift her shape and walk paths mortals never see.

Selune’thiel never learned the full truth of her origin, but sometimes, when she dreams, she remembers cold hands, chanting voices, and a silver eclipse carved into stone. She believes something meant her to bring ruin—but she refuses.  
Instead, she walks the world defending the balance, hunting those who twist nature for power, and watching the shadows that cling to her soul with wary eyes.

She is the moon’s daughter—whether the moon wanted her or not.

- Has trouble understanding social customs and unnecessary small talk.
- Animals often behave strangely around her—curious, cautious, or protective.
