## 👨‍🎤 Description

Aeris Whisperwind is a soft-spoken half-elf whose presence is more felt than noticed. Slight and graceful, she carries a faint fragility but moves with deliberate poise. Her pale, faintly freckled skin and long silver-lavender hair frame luminous storm-gray eyes that seem to listen as much as they see.

She dresses in elegant, dark practical clothing suited for quiet movement, wearing a silver quill-and-lyre pendant tied to her family. Almost always at her side is her rune-etched lyre, _Thalen’s Voice_, which subtly responds to her emotions. Rather than commanding attention with brightness, Aeris draws it like a hushed melody — calm, observant, and quietly haunting.
