## 👨‍🎤 Description

Aeris Whisperwind is a soft-spoken half-elf whose presence is more felt than noticed. Slight and graceful, she carries a faint fragility but moves with deliberate poise. Her pale, faintly freckled skin and long silver-lavender hair frame luminous storm-gray eyes that seem to listen as much as they see.

She dresses in elegant, dark practical clothing suited for quiet movement, wearing a silver quill-and-lyre pendant tied to her family. Almost always at her side is her rune-etched lyre, _Thalen’s Voice_, which subtly responds to her emotions. Rather than commanding attention with brightness, Aeris draws it like a hushed melody — calm, observant, and quietly haunting.

## 🕯️ Backstory

Aeris Whisperwind was never meant to lift swords or wear armor. Born into the twilight lands between the elven city of Elarion and the cosmopolitan sprawl of Caelora, she grew up in a home of candlelit poetry, whispered lullabies, and layered truths.

Her body was always delicate — illness clung to her in childhood, and she tired quickly from even small exertions. She wasn’t raised to fight, but to observe, learn, and understand. Her mother, Lirae Whisperwind, a quiet elven noblewoman skilled in courtly subtlety, taught Aeris the art of reading unspoken emotions. Her father, a human playwright named Thalen Rook, gave her a love of words so powerful they could cut deeper than blades.

Aeris could listen to a room and know its secrets. She could speak a single sentence and change the course of a negotiation. Her wisdom made her intuitive and cautious; her intelligence made her curious and quick-thinking; and her charisma — that radiant, commanding presence — ensured that people listened when she spoke… even if they didn’t want to.

At twelve, Thalen vanished during a private performance for Elarion's high court. He left behind only a page torn from a script, stained in blood and ink — and a beautiful silver-stringed lyre, one he had commissioned in secret for Aeris. Its name was etched beneath the frame in fine script:

> “Let her voice carry what mine could not.”

Aeris named it Thalen’s Voice.

Grief-stricken and betrayed by her mother’s silence, Aeris fled Elarion. With Thalen’s Voice at her side, she began to walk the world, weaving songs that stirred hearts and uncovered secrets, hoping that one day, they would lead her to the truth.
