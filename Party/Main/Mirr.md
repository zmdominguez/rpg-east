## 🕯️ Backstory
Mirr grew up in the bustling shop of her parents, who dealt in rare and powerful artefacts. From a young age, she learned to appraise treasures, negotiate with eccentric collectors, and handle objects that could be as dangerous as they were valuable. Now striking out on her own, Mirr travels to source artefacts of legend, whether for resale, study, or personal power. Charismatic and pragmatic, Mirr can charm, barter, or manipulate their way through most situations—but their curiosity can sometimes lead them into peril.

## 👨‍🎤 Description
Standing tall as a Goliath, Mirr makes a big impression. She has inky purple skin with deep black tattoos that weave around her arms. Her jet black hair is always tightly braided, and she is very proud of it.

## 📝 Notes
- Has a random symbol tattoo on her arm after a drunk night. "slut".
