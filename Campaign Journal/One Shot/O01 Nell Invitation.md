## 💡Key Learnings

- [lore:: The party arrived in [[Thornhaven]] responding to urgent letters from Priestess [[Nell]]]
- [lore:: Something is troubling the [[Scarsith Temple]]]

## 🤝 Who Did We Meet?

**[[Nell]]** - Priestess of [[Scarsith]] who sent the urgent letters
**[[Bramwell]]** - Older halfling priest at the temple, welcomed the party

## 📝 Session Notes

### Arrival at Thornhaven

The party arrived in [[Thornhaven]], each having received an urgent letter from Priestess [[Nell]] of the [[Scarsith Temple]].

### The Graveyard Fight

The party encountered grave robbers at the cemetery. A hard-fought battle ensued with only three party members present. The party emerged victorious, though it was a close fight.

**Loot:** [[Qualam]] took a [[Graveyard Shortsword|shortsword]] from the lead robber. The blade feels strangely attuned to him.

### Meeting Nell

After the graveyard fight, [[Nell]] appeared. The party failed to respond correctly to her greeting - the traditional exchange of Scarsith faithful.

### The Temple

The party went to the [[Scarsith Temple]] to rest. Brother [[Bramwell]], an older halfling priest, welcomed them warmly on Nell's behalf and saw to their comfort.
