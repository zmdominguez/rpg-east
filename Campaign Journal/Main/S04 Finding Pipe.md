## 💡Key Learnings

- Venn built most of Thornhaven's structures including the rock fence, houses, water channels, and [[Scarsith Temple]]
- The [[World/Thornhaven Region/Veiled Peaks]] are dangerous - cold, wolves, and harsh weather


## 🤝 Who Did We Meet?

## 📝 Session Notes

- Met [[Eman]] at [[TownHall]] at 10am
