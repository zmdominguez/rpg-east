## 💡Key Learnings

- [[Pipe Ashford]] has been missing for three years, but was recently spotted alive
- [[Eman]] wants to find Pipe and has hired mercenaries
- [[Roderick Ashford]] is Pipe's father - still believes she's alive
- [[Venn]] is the Waterkeeper who maintains the mountain irrigation channels
- Venn built most of Thornhaven's structures including the rock fence, houses, water channels, and [[Scarsith Temple]]
- The [[World/Thornhaven Region/Veiled Peaks]] are dangerous - cold, wolves, and harsh weather


## 🤝 Who Did We Meet?

[[Eman]] - Mayor of Thornhaven, hired the party to find Pipe
[[Roderick Ashford]] - Pipe's father, fragile old man who never leaves his house
[[Venn]] - Dwarf Waterkeeper, maintains the mountain channels, not friendly to visitors

## 📝 Session Notes
- [[Aeris Whisperwind]] performed at [[Cross Bones Pub]], singing about the Thelasian adventure
- Late at night, two things arrived:
	- A letter slipped under the door with shaky handwriting and a simple map
	- A guard knocked with an official summons to [[TownHall]] for 10am
	- [[Mirr]] answered the door naked
- The party decided to find the letter's author that night
	- [[Kass]] went to find [[Selune]] in the forest
	- They arrived at [[Roderick Ashford]]'s house around midnight
- **Roderick's story:**
	- His daughter [[Pipe Ashford]] went missing three years ago
	- Everyone stopped looking, but he never gave up hope
	- He's weak and never leaves the house
	- Recently heard she was spotted on the mountains
- Next morning, the party tried to find [[Venn]] at the west gate - he wasn't there
- Met [[Eman]] at [[TownHall]] at 10am
	- Eman gave them the quest to find Pipe
	- Introduced them to [[Venn]]
	- Made clear other mercenaries are also looking - she doesn't put "all her eggs in one basket"
- [[Venn]] was unhelpful
	- Hates being in the city
	- Gave them a map and shallow information about the peaks
- The party accepted both quests (Eman's and Roderick's)
- Bought winter gear and headed to the [[World/Thornhaven Region/Veiled Peaks]]
- **The Ice Bridge:**
	- Challenging crossing over a chasm
	- [[Selune]] fell into the creek below
- **The Snowstorm:**
	- A whiteout hit during travel
	- Party navigated through successfully
- Found [[Venn]]'s cabin in the mountains
	- He refused to open the door
	- Party spotted another person inside
	- Venn is secretive about his personal life
- Session ended at dawn
	- A large white wolf watched the party from the mist
	- Disappeared before they could react
- [question:: Who is the in Venn's cabin?]
