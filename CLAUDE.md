# RPG-East Campaign Vault

This is an Obsidian vault for managing a tabletop RPG campaign called "East RPG."

## Project Type
- Obsidian knowledge management vault
- Collaborative D&D-style campaign documentation

## Technologies
- Obsidian with Dataview plugin
- Markdown files with YAML front matter
- CSS for custom styling

## Directory Structure
- `/Party` - Player characters organized by campaign (Main, CrossBonesInc)
- `/Campaign Journal` - Session notes (S## for main, X## for Cross Bones, O## for one-shots)
- `/NPCs` - Non-player characters with metadata (species, occupation, location)
- `/World` - Locations, landmarks, and world-building
- `/Items` - Magical items and resources
- `/z_Templates` - Reusable templates for sessions and callouts

## Conventions

- Content is interconnected via Obsidian wiki-links `[[like this]]`
- Dataview queries are used for dynamic content display
