# /update-timeline

Update the world timeline with major historical events.

## Usage
```
/update-timeline
```

## Instructions

1. Read the current timeline at `World/Timeline.md`

2. Review recent session notes to identify **major world events** (not individual session activities):
   - Wars, battles, or conflicts
   - Political changes (new rulers, alliances, treaties)
   - Natural disasters or magical catastrophes
   - Founding or destruction of locations
   - Deaths or disappearances of significant figures
   - Discovery of important artifacts or knowledge
   - Large-scale social changes

3. Ask the user:
   - What major event should be added?
   - What year did it occur?
   - Brief description (1-2 sentences)
   - Related wiki-links (NPCs, locations, sessions)

4. The timeline format is:
```markdown
# Year 0
- [[S00 The Quiet Year]]

# Year 1

# Year 2
- [[O00 Owl Curse]]
- The Saving War - The Army, under [[Eman]] command push the Owls away from the city

# Year 3
...
```

5. Guidelines:
   - Only add **world-changing events**, not session-by-session details
   - Link to relevant sessions, NPCs, and locations
   - Keep descriptions concise but meaningful
   - Maintain chronological order within each year
   - Session links (S##, X##, O##) can be included if the session covers a major event

6. After updating, show the user the changes made

7. Proactively suggest timeline updates when:
   - A session introduces significant lore
   - New historical information is revealed
   - Major events occur during gameplay
