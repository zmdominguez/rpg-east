## Description
The main agricultural operation feeding Thornhaven. Unlike traditional farms, Tinkboom Grounds is run by a community of goblins who have built an array of mechanical contraptions to automate planting, harvesting, and irrigation.

## Key Features
- **Mechanical harvesters:** Goblin-built machines that cut and gather crops
- **Irrigation pumps:** Connected to [[Venn]]'s water channels from the [[World/Thornhaven Region/Veiled Peaks|Veiled Peaks]]
- **Seed distributors:** Wheeled devices that plant rows with precision
- **The Workshop:** Central building where goblins design and repair their inventions

## Key NPCs
- [[Tok]] - inventor and unofficial spokesman for the goblin workers

## Notes
- The goblins are happy here - they're free to create and invent as much as they want
- Thornhaven's rapid growth without food shortages is largely thanks to this farm
- The machines are loud, clanky, and occasionally explode (harmlessly, mostly)
- Other settlements have tried to recruit the goblins, but they prefer the farm freedom
